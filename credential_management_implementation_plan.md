# PowerFlex Credential Management System Implementation Plan

## 1. Analysis Phase [ ]

- [x] Understand existing PowerFlex client architecture
- [x] Review credential management documentation in `docs/` directory
- [ ] Identify API requirements and limitations
- [ ] Define credential data models and serialization formats

### Findings from Analysis

- PowerFlex credential management API requires XML format for requests
- Different credential types are specified via XML tags (serverCredential, vCenterCredential, etc.)
- PowerFlex Gateway credentials (scaleIOCredential) can be updated in PowerFlex Manager
- Gateway versions below 4.0 do not support credential operations
- Response formats support both JSON and XML
- Some credential types support an optional domain parameter
- When retrieving all credentials, XML format must be used exclusively
- Credential type is determined from XML element tag during parsing

## 2. Design Phase [ ]

- [ ] Design `Credential` class structure aligning with existing client patterns
- [ ] Design XML serialization/deserialization for credential payloads
- [ ] Design PowerFlex Gateway version detection for compatibility checks
- [ ] Define credential type validation system
- [ ] Plan error handling for unsupported operations

## 3. Implementation Phase [ ]

### 3.1 Constants and Exceptions [ ]

- [ ] Add `CredentialConstants` in `constants.py` with:
  - [ ] Credential types and XML templates
  - [ ] API endpoints and content types
  - [ ] Gateway version compatibility constants
  - [ ] Domain support for applicable credential types
- [ ] Create credential-specific exceptions in `exceptions.py`:
  - [ ] `PowerFlexCredentialNotSupported` for Gateway version incompatibility
  - [ ] `PowerFlexCredentialTypeError` for invalid credential types
  - [ ] `PowerFlexFailCredentialOperation` for operation failures

### 3.2 Core Implementation [ ]

- [ ] Create `credential.py` in the `objects` directory with:
  - [ ] `Credential` class extending `EntityRequest`
  - [ ] XML serialization utility methods
  - [ ] Gateway version compatibility check
  - [ ] CRUD operations implementation:
    - [ ] `create()` - Add new credential (requiring explicit type)
    - [ ] `get()` - Retrieve credential(s) in XML format
    - [ ] `update()` - Update existing credential (using detected type)
    - [ ] `delete()` - Remove credential
  - [ ] Type detection from XML for transparent updates
  - [ ] Domain parameter support for applicable credential types

### 3.3 Client Integration [ ]

- [ ] Update `objects/__init__.py` to expose Credential class
- [ ] Update `PyPowerFlex/__init__.py` to import Credential functionality
- [ ] Update any relevant client classes to integrate credential management

## 4. Testing Phase [ ]

### 4.1 Unit Tests [ ]

- [ ] Create `test_credential.py` in the `tests` directory
- [ ] Implement test cases for:
  - [ ] XML serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Credential type detection from XML
  - [ ] Gateway version compatibility check
  - [ ] Domain parameter handling
  - [ ] Error handling for:
    - [ ] Invalid credential types
    - [ ] Unsupported Gateway versions
    - [ ] API operation failures

### 4.2 Integration Tests [ ]

- [ ] Implement mock responses based on API documentation
- [ ] Test credential creation with various credential types
- [ ] Test credential retrieval (single and all)
- [ ] Test credential updates with automatic type detection
- [ ] Test credential deletion
- [ ] Test Gateway version compatibility checks
- [ ] Test domain parameter functionality

## 5. Documentation Update [ ]

- [ ] Update README.md with credential management information
- [ ] Create usage examples for all credential operations
- [ ] Document Gateway version compatibility limitations
- [ ] Document credential type requirements and automatic detection
- [ ] Document domain parameter support for applicable credential types

## Detailed Implementation Notes

### Credential Types
The system will support the following credential types:
- `serverCredential` - For nodes
- `iomCredential` - For switches
- `vCenterCredential` - For vCenter
- `emCredential` - For Element Manager
- `scaleIOCredential` - For PowerFlex Gateway
- `PSCredential` - For presentation server
- `OSCredential` - For operating system administrator
- `OSUserCredential` - For operating system user

### XML Handling
For credential operations:
- Create/Update operations require XML request payloads
- Response payloads can be either JSON or XML
- Type detection will parse XML responses to identify credential type from element tags

### Gateway Version Compatibility
- PowerFlex Gateway credentials can be updated in PowerFlex Manager
- Operations will be blocked for PowerFlex Gateway versions below 4.0
- The system will perform version checks before allowing credential operations

### Domain Parameter Support
The following credential types support the optional domain parameter:
- `vCenterCredential`
- `emCredential`
- `PSCredential`
- `OSCredential`
- `OSUserCredential`

The implementation will validate and handle this parameter for these specific types.
